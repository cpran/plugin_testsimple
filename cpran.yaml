Description:
  Short: (deprecated) simple implementation of the Test Anything Protocol
  Long: >
    This plugin originally implemented an interface for testing using the 
    Test Anything Protocol (TAP).

    This plugin has been superseded by the "tap" plugin, which offers a 
    better interface for testing, with additional optional features.
    Development in this plugin has moved to the "tap" plugin. This will
    remain available for backwards compatibility only.
